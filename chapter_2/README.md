# 2. Object-Oriented Scala ğŸŸ¥.

Considering the preceding features of OOP languages, in this chapter, we will discuss the basic object-oriented features in Scala ğŸŸ¥. In a nutshell, the following topics will be covered in this chapter: 

- ğŸŸª Variable in Scala.
- ğŸ”µ Methods, classes, and objects in Scala.
- ğŸ”¸ Packages and package objects.
- ğŸ”· Traits and trait linerization.
- â˜• Java Interoperability.

### Variables in Scala ğŸŸ¥.

The formal syntax of declaring a variable in Scala ğŸŸ¥ is as follows:

<code>val or var VariableName: DataType = Initial_Value</code>

There are two types of variables in Scala ğŸŸ¥: mutable and immutable that can be defined as follows:

- ğŸ”µ **Mutable:** The ones whose values you can change later.
- ğŸŸ£ **Immutable:** The ones whose values you cannot change once they habe been set.

In Scala ğŸŸ¥ variables, we can three differentes scopes, depending on the place where you have declared them:

- ğŸŸª **Fields:** These are variables that belong to an instance of a class of your Scala code.
- ğŸ”´ **Methods arguments:** These are variables, and when the method is called, these can be used to pass the value inside a method.
- ğŸ’¡ **Local variables:** These variables are declared inside a method and are accessible from the inside the method itself.
